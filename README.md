# Quick Xournal++

 Allows to quickly create and link xournal++ files.

 Currently it provides one command: `Quick Xournal++`

 This will issue a prompt which asks for the filename, after submitting it, the plugin will create two files:
 - An empty xournal file (copied from `empty.xopp` in this repository/plugin-directory, so you could replace that with a template of your own)
 - An exported PDF file from that copied file
 - Both will then be linked into the current note at your cursor-position.
